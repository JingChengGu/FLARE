# **FLARE Project**
### **Fault Logging and Assessment for Responsive EV Repairs**

The **FLARE** project aims to **automate fault detection** in EV charging stations using **Semantic Segmentation** and **CNN-based Image Classification**. By leveraging real-world data, we help identify charger malfunctions faster and improve maintenance response times.

---

## **Project Overview**
🔹 **Problem**: Broken EV chargers make charging unreliable for EV owners.  
🔹 **Solution**: AI-driven fault detection using image senmatic segmentation and binary classifier.
🔹 **Goal**: Increase charger reliability and accelerate EV adoption.  

---


## **How It Works**
1️⃣ **Users take a photo** of a faulty EV charger.  
2️⃣ **AI models classify** the issue (e.g., damaged cord, broken screen).  
3️⃣ **Reports are sent** to service providers for faster maintenance.

🚀 Our goal is to create **a smarter, more reliable EV infrastructure!**
